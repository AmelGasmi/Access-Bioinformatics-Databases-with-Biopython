# Access Bioinformatics Databases with Biopython



## Project Overview

By the end of this project, you will:

- Learn to access, parse, and visualize data from various bioinformatics sequence and structural online databases such as ENTREZ, PDB, KEGG, and NCBI using Biopython.
- Interact with various bioinformatics file formats such as FASTA, PDB, GENBANK, and XML.
- Utilize various parsers to read and modify these files using Biopython.

## Learning Objectives

- Perform sequence alignment using NCBI-BLAST.
- Fetch üïµÔ∏èPUBMED articles üìÑ and nucleotide sequences using ENTREZ.
- FetchüïµÔ∏è and visualize proteins from PDB.
- Access PROSITE and SCANPROSITE databases from EXPASY.
- Access the KEGG database for biological pathway analysis.
